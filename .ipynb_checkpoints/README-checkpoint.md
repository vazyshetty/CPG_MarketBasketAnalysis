Frequent Itemsets via Apriori Algorithm Apriori function to extract frequent itemsets for association rule mining We have a dataset of a mall with 7500 transactions of different customers buying different items from the store. We have to find correlations between the different items in the store. so that we can know if a customer is buying apple, banana and mango. what is the next item, The customer would be interested in buying from the store.

Apriori is a popular algorithm for extracting frequent itemsets with applications in association rule learning. The apriori algorithm has been designed to operate on databases containing transactions, such as purchases by customers of a store. An itemset is considered as "frequent" if it meets a user-specified support threshold. For instance, if the support threshold is set to 0.5 (50%), a frequent itemset is defined as a set of items that occur together in at least 50% of all transactions in the database.
